## Token vs JWTs in Express

In Express, tokens and JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) are two different ways to authenticate users. A token is a random string generated by the server and returned to the client, which is then sent back to the server with each request. The server can then verify the token and authenticate the user.

JWTs, on the other hand, are a type of token that contain a payload (usually the user's ID and other information) that is encrypted and signed with a secret key. When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT and returns it to the client. The client then sends the JWT back to the server with each request, and the server can verify the JWT and authenticate the user.

The main difference between tokens and JWTs is that tokens are opaque and contain no information, while JWTs contain information that can be verified by the server. Tokens are also more prone to being tampered with, as they are just a random string, while JWTs are more secure as they are encrypted and signed.

In Express, tokens are usually used for session-based authentication, while JWTs are used for token-based authentication. With tokens, the server stores the user's session information, while with JWTs, the server does not store any information, and the client is responsible for storing the JWT.

In general, JWTs are more secure and scalable than tokens, as they do not require the server to store any information, and can be easily verified and authenticated. However, tokens can be simpler to implement and can be used for simpler authentication scenarios.
